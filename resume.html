                    <h2>About Me and Academic Honesty</h2>
                    <P>
                        Hello, I am Chen Yang. I come from a small city in Northwest China, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. I went to school and lived in Canada for about four years. Canada is a beautiful and diverse country, I love it. Last year, due to COVID-19, I came back to my hometown and then started my online learning life. In my free time, I like to read, watch films, play games, and I love succulents, so I plant lots of succulents on the balcony of my room. During my college time, I studied and mastered C language, web, database. I think itâ€™s fun to make a webpage. When I complete making a webpage, I will have a sense of accomplishment. So, I want to be a web developer. I think I have the ability to become a professional web developer.
                    </P>
                    <P>
